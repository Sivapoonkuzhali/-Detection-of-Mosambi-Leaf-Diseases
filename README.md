# 🍃 Detection of Mosambi Leaf Diseases using YOLOv8

This project implements a **YOLOv8-based real-time object detection model** to detect and classify various **Mosambi (Sweet Lime) leaf diseases**. By leveraging a custom image dataset, this model aims to support **early diagnosis** and help improve **crop health monitoring and management**.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

* 🚀 Trained a YOLOv8 model on a **custom-labeled Mosambi leaf dataset**
* 🧠 Real-time detection and classification of leaf diseases
* 📈 Boosts precision in early disease identification for better yield outcomes
* ⚡️ Lightweight and fast – optimized for edge deployment and field use

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

* **Type:** Custom dataset of Mosambi leaf images
* **Classes:** Healthy, Leaf Spot, Bacterial Blight, Mosaic Virus, etc.
* **Format:** Annotated using YOLO format (bounding boxes with class labels)
* **Tools Used:** Roboflow / CVAT (for annotation)

> Note: The dataset is not publicly available due to data privacy or collection limitations.

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Detection-of-Mosambi-Leaf-Diseases.git
   cd Detection-of-Mosambi-Leaf-Diseases
   ```

2. **Create environment & install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install YOLOv8 via Ultralytics**

   ```bash
   pip install ultralytics

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training

If you're using your own dataset:

```bash
yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data=leaf.yaml epochs=50 imgsz=640
```

Replace `leaf.yaml` with your dataset config file specifying class names and paths.

---

## 🔍 Inference

To run detection on a single image or folder:

```bash
yolo task=detect mode=predict model=best.pt source=path/to/image_or_folder
```

> Output will include labeled images and bounding boxes with confidence scores.
